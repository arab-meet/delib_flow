DelibFlow Documentation (Hybrid Approach)
=========================================

.. note::
   **This is the Hybrid / Role-Based Prototype.**
   It organizes documentation by **Role** (User vs Developer) but keeps components highly connected.

Welcome to the DelibFlow documentation. This project provides a Behavior Tree-based framework for TIAGo robots, integrating Navigation, Manipulation, and Perception.
